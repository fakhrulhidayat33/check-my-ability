# AI-Assisted Programmer Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for self-learners who want to become **productive programmers** using AI as a coding assistant.  
It is divided into **4 stages**, each with **clear indicators** to track your progress.

---

## **Stage 1: Fundamentals**

**Goal:** Build a strong foundation in programming logic and basic Python.

**Indicators:**
- [v] I can write simple Python scripts without copying from AI.
- [v] I understand variables, loops, and conditions enough to predict code outputs.
- [v] I can read AI-generated code and explain what each line does.
- [v] I can solve basic problems like:
  - **Generate a multiplication table**
  - ~~Count vowels in a string~~
  - ~~Sort a list of numbers~~

---

## **Stage 2: Build Small Projects**

**Goal:** Move from theory to small practical projects (50â€“200 lines).

**Indicators:**
- [ ] I can start and finish a small project without giving up.
- [ ] I can debug errors with AI help and understand the fix.
- [ ] I can modify AI-generated scripts to suit my needs.
- [ ] Iâ€™ve built at least one project like:
  - File renamer for 100+ files
  - Simple CSV-based expense tracker

---

## **Stage 3: Automation & Data Skills**

**Goal:** Handle real-world tasks involving data and automation.

**Indicators:**
- [ ] I can read and write CSV/Excel/JSON files with Python.
- [ ] I can scrape or fetch data from the web.
- [ ] I can automate repetitive tasks for myself or others.
- [ ] I can combine 2â€“3 skills in one script, e.g.:
  - Scrape website data â†’ Save to Excel â†’ Clean the data automatically

---

## **Stage 4: AI + Human Synergy**

**Goal:** Use AI as a coding partner to build real-world solutions.

**Indicators:**
- [ ] I can plan a project from problem to solution before writing code.
- [ ] I use AI as an assistant, not a crutchâ€”I understand and adapt its code.
- [ ] I can deliver real-world value, like a script that saves hours of work.
- [ ] I can optimize or extend AI-generated code without breaking it.

### âœ… How to Use This README
1. **Check off each indicator** as you achieve it.
2. **Move to the next stage** only when all indicators are checked.
3. **Optional:** Add links to your finished projects under each stage.
