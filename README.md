# AI-Assisted Programmer Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for self-learners who want to become **productive programmers** using AI as a coding assistant.  
It is divided into **4 stages**, each with **clear indicators** to track your progress.

---

## **Stage 1: Fundamentals**

**Goal:** Build a strong foundation in programming logic and basic Python.

**Indicators:**
- [v] I can write simple Python scripts without copying from AI.
- [v] I understand variables, loops, and conditions enough to predict code outputs.
- [v] I can read AI-generated code and explain what each line does.
- [v] I can solve basic problems like:
  - **Generate a multiplication table**
  - ~~Count vowels in a string~~
  - ~~Sort a list of numbers~~

**Example Script:**  
- [table-multiplication.py](table-multiplication.py)  
- [table-multiplication.txt](table-multiplication.txt) *(sample output)*

**About the Script:**  
- Generates a multiplication table from **1Ã—1 up to NÃ—M**.  
- Uses **dynamic indent** to format the table neatly.  
- Outputs the table to a `.txt` file.  
- Current version: **1.2**  
  - 1.1 â†’ Static indent  
  - 1.2 â†’ Dynamic indent based on largest cell  
  - 1.3 â†’ *(Planned)* Dynamic indent per column

## **Stage 2: Build Small Projects**

**Goal:** Move from theory to small practical projects (50â€“200 lines).

**Planned Next Steps:**
- [v] Create multiple multiplication tables in one run.  
- [v] Save files with dynamic filenames, e.g., `table_10x5.txt`.  
- [v] Export a CSV version for real-world usage.  
- [v] Start building my first **small project** combining input, file handling, and logic.

### Stage 2.5: Small Project - Multiplication Table CLI Tool

- [ ] CLI interface for rows/columns and output format selection  
- [v] Flexible output: text, CSV, or both  
- [ ] CSV export uses `csv.writer` with headers  
- [v] Dynamic, descriptive filenames  
- [ ] Input validation with clear error messages  
- [ ] Logging or status feedback on run  
- [ ] Defaults if no arguments provided  
- [ ] Self-test or example mode  
- [ ] Clean function separation (generate, write_text, write_csv, main)  
- [ ] Usage example documented in README  
- [ ] (Optional) Basic automated test for correctness

## **Stage 3: Automation & Data Skills**

- Coming soon.  
- Will focus on **CSV/Excel handling**, **web scraping**, and **task automation**.

---

## **Stage 4: AI + Human Synergy**

- Coming soon.  
- Will focus on **building useful tools** using **AI-assisted coding**.

### âœ… How I Use This Repo
1. **Track my progress** through the stages.  
2. **Check off indicators** as I gain new skills.  
3. **Show my learning journey** with both code and documentation.
